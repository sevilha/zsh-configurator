# zsh-configurator

Whenever I format my PC, I need to reconfigure Zsh. I often forget the specific commands or resources I used to customize my terminal. To address this, I decided to create this script.

## Steps
- SO update
- install ZSH
- change sh terminal
- install wget
- crate fonts dir
- get font
- install git
- clone PowerLevel10k theme rpository
- configure p10k
